## Overview

With PrintingKit, you just have to create a ``Printer`` instance or use ``Printer/shared``, then use it to print any of the supported ``PrintItem`` types with a single line of code.

PrintingKit works on both iOS and macOS.



## Installation

PrintingKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:
